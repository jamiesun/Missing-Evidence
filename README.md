# Missing-Evidence

A collection of short stories.

These stories are not written to explain ideas.
They are written to show what happens
when someone treats an absence as a fact
and acts on it.

## What This Project Is

This repository contains short fiction only.

Each story is built around:
- one concrete event
- one irreversible choice
- one observable consequence

There are no excerpts, no chapters, and no fragments.
Every text here is intended to stand alone.

---

## What This Project Is NOT

- Not a novel-in-progress
- Not character sketches
- Not worldbuilding notes
- Not philosophical essays in disguise

If a story cannot survive without prior context,
it does not belong here.

---

## Core Constraints

All stories in this project follow these rules:

1. **Single event**
   - One situation
   - One pressure point
   - No parallel timelines

2. **Action over explanation**
   - No author commentary
   - No thematic summaries
   - Meaning must emerge from behavior

3. **Absence must have weight**
   - Something expected does not appear
   - Someone notices
   - A decision is made because of it
   - The decision has a cost

4. **Short story scale**
   - Focus on exposure, not growth
   - Characters reveal who they are
   - They do not complete arcs

## Language

- Concrete nouns over abstract terms
- Physical actions over emotional labels
- Sensory detail is preferred
- Vague adjectives are avoided

If a sentence cannot be observed,
it is rewritten or removed.

## Why This Exists

This project exists to test one question:

> What does the world do
> when someone mistakes silence,
> delay, or absence
> for certainty?

No conclusions are provided.
Only outcomes.

---

## Status

Ongoing.

Stories are added when they are finished,
not when they are timely.
